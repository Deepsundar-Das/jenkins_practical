## Difference Between Clean Lifecycle and Default Lifecycle

**1. The Clean Lifecycle:**
The purpose of the Clean lifecycle is to remove all files generated by the previous build. It ensures that you are starting fresh and no old, compiled artifacts interfere with a new build.
* **Key Phase:** `clean` (Deletes the `target/` directory).

**2. The Default Lifecycle:**
The Default lifecycle is the core of Maven. Its purpose is to handle the actual building, testing, and deployment of the project. 
* **Key Phases:** * `validate` (checks if project is correct)
  * `compile` (compiles source code)
  * `test` (runs unit tests)
  * `package` (packages compiled code into a JAR/WAR)
  * `install` (installs the package into the local repository)
  * `deploy` (copies the final package to a remote repository)
